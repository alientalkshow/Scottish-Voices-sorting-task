# Scottish Voices sorting task

This private repository supports a research study exploring how Scottish speakers are perceived and categorised based on how they sound. The study focuses on auditory similarity judgments made by participants when listening to short speech samples.

## Data Collection

Participant responses—such as speaker groupings and interaction data—are submitted via [insert platform name, e.g. Gorilla, Qualtrics, Google Forms, etc.]. These responses are securely stored and later imported into this repository for analysis.

## What Participants Do
On the next slide, participants see a grid and 12 black rectangles, each labeled with the initials of one speaker. All speakers are saying the same sentence. 

All data is stored in the `/data/raw` directory and processed using R scripts located in `/scripts`.

Participants can:
- Click on a rectangle to hear the corresponding speaker.
- Listen to any speaker as many times as they like.
- Move the rectangles onto the grid to create groupings based on how similar the speakers sound in how they speak.
- Create as few or as many groupings as they feel are appropriate.

An example of how the final groupings might appear is shown on the slide, but participants are encouraged to group according to their own perception.
