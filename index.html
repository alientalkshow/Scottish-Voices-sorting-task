        On the next slide, you will see a grid and 12 black rectangles with the initials of 12 speakers who all are saying the same sentence. Once you click on a rectangle you can hear the speaker. Your task is to listen to all speakers and to move the rectangles onto the grid to group them together by how similar they sound in how they speak. You can listen to the speakers as often as you want to, and you can build as few or as many groupings as you like. Below is just an example of what your groupings could look like.
