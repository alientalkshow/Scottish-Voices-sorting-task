        These 12 icons have the initials of 12 speakers who all are saying the same sentence.
        Once you click on an icon, you can hear the speaker. Your task is to listen to all speakers
        and move the rectangles onto the grid to group them together by how similar they sound.
        Place the blocks close if they belong to one group and further apart if they sound different.
        The distance between different groups does not matter.
        You can listen as often as you want and create as few or as many groups as you like.
