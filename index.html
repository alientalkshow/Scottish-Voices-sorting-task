          These 12 icons have the initials of 12 speakers who all are saying the same sentence.
          Once you click on an icon, you can hear the speaker. Your task is to listen to all speakers
          and to move the rectangles onto the grid to group them together by how similar they sound in
          how they speak. Place the blocks close to each other if you think they belong to one group and
          further apart if they sound different. You can listen to the speakers as often as you want,
          and you can create as few or as many groupings as you'd like.
